v0.9 beta
---------

* Feature: Completely revamped recognition core now supports continuous speech recognition and better accuracy (you can say many commands in a single phrase without pausing between them).

* Feature: Command recognition confidence threshold - PiLfIuS! only responds to commands when it has a reasonable certainty that it has recognized it correctly.

* Feature: Interference detection

* Feature: Significantly faster keystroke output

* Feature: Hold key down for x milliseconds before release

* Feature: Mouse button press and mouse wheel motion emulation

* Feature: Allow key combinations recognized by Windows to be added (such as Ctrl-F4, Alt-F4, Ctrl-Alt-Del).

* Feature: Repeat action (keystroke / mouse buttons) n times

* Feature: Use mouse and joystick buttons or joystick HAT to trigger the activation feature (Push-to-activate, Push-to-deactivate, Push-to-toggle)

* Feature: Option to disable command actions

* Feature: Output of last recognized command

* Feature: PiLfIuS! is restricted to one instance

* Installer: (for Vista users) Installer will now install and register comdlg32.ocx and comdlg32.dll only if they don't exist already -regardless of version-.

* Bugfix (introduced in 0.7): One of the processes causes the application to needlessly use a significant amount of idle processor resources.

* Bugfix: When the last command in a Command List file has no keystrokes assigned, after loading the Command List and either speaking or clicking that command, the program crashes.

* Bugfix: When closing a command list with unsaved changes, a dialog pops up asking whether you want to save. Answering "No" will prompt the dialog a second time, while unloading the main screen.

* Bugfix: When closing a previously-unsaved command list with unsaved changes, answering "Yes" when prompted to save will cause the program to crash.

* Bugfix: Pressing the CANCEL button at the SAVE AS... dialog when saving a Command List saves the file anyway.

* Bugfix: Loading saved command lists containing keystrokes consisting of only shift, ctrl and/or alt resulted in corrupted commands, which would cause a CTD and other erratic behavior when recognized, or when certain actions are performed on them.

* Bugfix: Under certain desktop styles, annoying scrollbars are visible along the bottom and right borders of the application.

* Bugfix: About button can only be clicked on the first screen.


v0.72 beta
----------

* Feature: Load command lists directly from command-line.

* Bugfix: ALT key is not properly recognized by games.

* Bugfix: If no Speech Recognition Engine is installed, the program will notify you with an error message. After you acknowledge that message, the program will crash.


v0.7 beta
---------

* Feature: When run for the first time, user will be prompted to configure the Speech Recognition Engine and microphone.

* Feature: New menu item to configure the Speech Recognition Engine and microphone.

* Feature: Added ENTER, ESC, DEL, INSERT keys functionality to the GUI when logical.

* Feature: Added Press-to-activate, Press-to-deactivate and Press-to-toggle functionality.

* Bugfix: Certain games don't recognize PiLfIuS! keystrokes since they require the key to be depressed for a few milliseconds before release.

* Bugfix: Clicking DELETE KEYSTROKE, MOVE KEYSTROKE UP/DOWN and DELETE COMMAND when there're items in the listbox, but none selected, causes a crash.

* Bugfix: After a new GROUP is ADDed, next time ADD GROUP is opened, the group name entered previously will show.

* Bugfix: Adding keystrokes consisting of only shift, ctrl and/or alt causes CTDs at several points.

* Bugfix: After deleting a group, following groups show commands from the group that succeed them rather than their own.

* Bugfix: INS, DEL, HOME, END, PGUP, PGDOWN, ARROW KEYS are not properly sent as keystrokes (will work OK with simple applications, but won't on most games).

* Bugfix: Key combinations that contain SHIFT, CTRL and/or ALT do not work properly under certain games.
